\title{Example Genomic Ranges with Repeat Annotations}
\format{
A \code{GRanges} object with 6 ranges and 1 metadata column:
\describe{
\item{seqnames}{Rle, chromosome or sequence names where each range is located (e.g., chr1, chr10).}
\item{ranges}{IRanges, start and end positions of each range within the chromosome.}
\item{strand}{Rle, strand information (\code{*} indicates no strand specificity).}
\item{repeat_class}{Character, metadata column indicating the repeat class of each range, such as "SINE," "LINE," or "simple_repeat".}
}

\usage{
example_repeats_all
}
\description{
A \code{GRanges} object representing genomic ranges with associated repeat class annotations, used for analyses involving repetitive elements across the genome.
}
\details{
This dataset includes genomic ranges with annotated repeat classes, useful for analyzing repetitive elements. The \code{seqinfo} metadata contains 25 sequences from an unspecified genome with undefined sequence lengths.
