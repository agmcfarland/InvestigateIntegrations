\title{Find Overlaps in Repeat Regions}
\usage{
find_overlaps_in_repeats(aavenger_table, repeat_table_grange, site_type)
}
\arguments{
\item{aavenger_table}{A data frame containing AAvengeR data, including positional identifiers that can be split into chromosome and position information.}

\item{repeat_table_grange}{A \code{GRanges} object containing repeat regions to compare against.}

\item{site_type}{A character string specifying the site type, either \code{"unique"} or \code{"multihits"}. Must be one of these two values.}
}
\value{
A data frame or \code{GRanges} object with the overlaps between \code{aavenger_table} and \code{repeat_table_grange}. The result includes columns marking the overlap for both the query (\code{aavenger_table}) and subject (\code{repeat_table_grange}) ranges.
}
\description{
This function identifies overlaps between positions in an AAvengeR table and repeat regions. It returns a table of overlaps, marking both the query and subject ranges.
}
\details{
Can take as input either an aavenger unique sites table or an aavenger multihits cluster table.
\itemize{
\item For \code{"unique"}: positions are extracted, converted to genomic ranges with \code{start} and \code{end} set to \code{position}.
\item For \code{"multihits"}: the table is unnested, split into \code{chromosome} and \code{position}, and converted to genomic ranges.
}
The function then calls \code{extract_overlaps()} to identify overlaps between the processed \code{aavenger_table} and \code{repeat_table_grange}.
